With over a decade of professional experience, I am a master painter and visual artist whose work spans murals, portraits, illustration, animation, drawing, and fine art commissions. My practice is rooted in craftsmanship, observation, and storytelling by creating work that connects emotionally while maintaining technical excellence. I bring consistency, creativity, and a deep respect for the art-making process every time I create." -Dat Artist

  <h1>BIO ABOUT,"DAT ARTIST"</h1>
<P class="text-box2">Stefon Penn, known artistically as Dat Artist, is a visionary creator from Norfolk, Virginia whose life centers on art, resilience, and community impact. Drawing from as early as age two, he developed his talent independently, earning awards and building a personal archive of his work from childhood. As a teenager, he became known for custom clothing designs and constantly drawing, earning the name “Dat Artist.” Years prior, he completed his 1st mural in Maury High School in exchange to be exempt on his final exam. </P>
<P class="text-box2">After graduation, Stefon worked in retail management while pursuing music, securing industry meetings and a record deal, yet feeling creatively unfulfilled. In 2012–2013, he recommitted to visual art, adopting the signature 13cent and later forming the foundation of his Pureheartshow identity. A transformative experience in Florida and inspiration from Jean-Michel Basquiat solidified his purpose to represent and uplift his community through art. </P>
<P class="text-box2">From 2013 onward, Stefon fully dedicated himself to painting, exhibiting widely and overcoming obstacles with determination. In 2017, he realized a childhood dream by opening The Pureheartshow Art Gallery at Norfolk’s Military Circle Mall, where he curated exhibitions, painted 8 large-scale murals, and became a pillar of the local art scene until the mall’s closure in 2023. His work earned regional recognition, including being named Best Painter of the 757 in 2019, and led to collaborations with numerous public figures. </P>
<P class="text-box2">Beyond personal success, Stefon has been deeply committed to mentorship, youth education, and community outreach, teaching artists of all ages and supporting local businesses through design and branding. In recent years, he has expanded into animation, UX design, and software development, blending fine art with technology while preserving his extensive body of work. </P>
<P class="text-box2">Today, Stefon Penn is a multifaceted artist, mentor, and innovator whose Pureheartshow brand represents a mission to inspire, empower, and create lasting impact. He envisions global, immersive art exhibitions and continues to build a legacy rooted in creativity, perseverance, and the belief that a pure heart can overcome any limitation. </P>
